# EECS 151/251A FPGA Project Skeleton for Fall 2023
Check out the [Project Overview](./spec/overview.md) to see the specs.

**Checkpoint 1:** 3-stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor Block Design Diagram

**Checkpoint 2:** Fully functional 3-stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor

**Checkpoint 3:** Working with UART, creating FIFO and audio synthesizer to make piano notes

**Checkpoint 4:** Processor Optimization (100MHz): current benchmark 85MHz (5 stages) with CPI = 3.06 for mmult operation.

# Note:
In branch optimization-5stage is the implementation of 5-stage pipeline CPU. The main one only contains 3-stage pipeline CPU.

# EECS 151/251A FPGA Project Skeleton for Fall 2023
Check out the [Project Overview](./spec/overview.md) to see the specs.

**Checkpoint 1:** 3-stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor Block Design Diagram

**Checkpoint 2:** Fully functional 3-stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor

**Checkpoint 3:** TBA

**Checkpoint 4:** Processor Optimization (100MHz)

# Note:
In branch `optimization-5stage` is the implementation of 5-stage pipeline CPU. The `optimization` branch contains a 4-stage pipelined CPU with no forwarding. The `main` branch only contains 3-stage pipeline CPU, but is the only branch that has all the I/O capabilities from Checkpoint 3.
